# Eaglercraft Site #
## What its about ##
### This site is used with no proxies or chats included, just simple Eaglercraft clients/games that people can enjoy playing around with! This is not used in any way to try to encourage anything bad but instead to encourage something fun which people will play the games for ###
## Why Did I do this ##
### I first made this site on a google site. As it was working well I kept hitting through barriers the made the gameplay more tiring and the fullscreen mode mandatory. With coding it in I can actually resolve most of these bugs to keep the site in one a better style with CSS and two it the bugs have been fixed! ###
## Please enjoy this site for good not for bad and thank you for reading this ##
